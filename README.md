# ExistedGit

Elevating Ukrainian programming since 2021.

# Primary interests

Average Neco-Arc, math & C++ enjoyer. Other compiled languages are nice too(no, not you, Java).

Interpreteted languages are heresy unless it's one implemented by me for a coding task.

HTML/(S)CSS/JS, P\*thon, C++, C# and a little bit of everything else

# On that grind
